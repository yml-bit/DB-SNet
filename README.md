# DB-SNet
This study addresses the critical need for accurate and efficient segmentation of aortic components and clinical phenotypes in chest-abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA). We propose a novel dual-branch segmentation network, DB-SNet, which simultaneously segments anatomical structures (e.g., lumen, calcified, non-calcified, and false lumen) and clinical phenotypes (e.g., aneurysm, dissection, stenosis, and normal) while maintaining high parameter efficiency and computational performance. The architecture incorporates shared encoder and bottleneck layers to leverage inter-task correlations, while task-specific decoder branches ensure optimal performance for each segmentation task.
